# Decentralized Governance and Virtual Property Platform

## Overview

A blockchain-powered platform combining decentralized governance mechanisms with virtual property NFT management, built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts.

## Key Features

### Governance Contract
- Proposal creation and management
- Voting system with vote tracking
- Proposal status tracking
- Democratic decision-making mechanism

### Virtual Property NFT Contract
- Non-fungible token representation of virtual properties
- Property metadata management
- Ownership tracking and transfer
- Owner-controlled minting

## Smart Contracts

### Governance Contract

#### Key Functions
- `create-proposal`: Initiate new governance proposals
- `vote`: Cast votes on active proposals
- `close-proposal`: Finalize proposal status
- `get-proposal`: Retrieve proposal details
- `get-vote`: Check individual voting records

#### Key Features
- Prevents duplicate voting
- Tracks votes for and against proposals
- Automatically determines proposal outcome

### Virtual Property NFT Contract

#### Key Functions
- `mint`: Create new virtual property NFTs
- `transfer`: Transfer property ownership
- `get-property-metadata`: Retrieve property details
- `get-owner`: Check property ownership

#### Key Features
- Owner-only minting
- Comprehensive property metadata
- Secure ownership transfer mechanism

## Use Cases

1. Decentralized Governance
    - Community-driven decision making
    - Transparent proposal lifecycle
    - Democratic voting process

2. Virtual Property Management
    - Tokenize virtual land or assets
    - Track property ownership
    - Enable property transfers
    - Store detailed property metadata

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks wallet
- Understanding of blockchain governance
- Familiarity with NFT concepts

### Deployment Steps
1. Deploy Governance Contract
2. Deploy Virtual Property NFT Contract
3. Connect Stacks wallet

### Example Workflow
1. Create a governance proposal
2. Community members vote
3. Close and resolve proposal
4. Mint and transfer virtual property NFTs

## Security Considerations
